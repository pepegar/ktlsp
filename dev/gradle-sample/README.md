# ktlsp gradle-sample

A realistic **Gradle (Kotlin DSL)** project used as a test fixture for the
[ktlsp](../../) Kotlin language server. Point ktlsp at this directory to verify:

- **library indexing** — ktlsp reads `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, resolves each library to a
  Maven coordinate, downloads its `-sources.jar` from Maven Central, and indexes the symbols;
- **goto-definition into dependencies** — jumping from `Json.encodeToString`, `delay`, `Flow`,
  `String.uppercase`, `Buffer`, etc. into the extracted library sources;
- **type-directed completion** against real library types;
- **project-local (Volatile-tier) indexing** — the `Greeter` hierarchy, the `String.shout()`
  extension, and the explicitly-typed functions exercise project-owned symbols and the
  type-inference work.

## Dependencies (declared in the version catalog)

All coordinates were verified against Maven Central, and each publishes a real `-sources.jar`
at its **root** coordinate (the exact `group:artifact:version` that ktlsp constructs the
sources-jar URL from — ktlsp does not append a `-jvm` suffix):

| Catalog alias                | Coordinate                                            | Sources jar |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `kotlin-stdlib`              | `org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:2.1.20`           | ✓ ~688 KB   |
| `kotlinx-serialization-json` | `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:1.7.3` | ✓ ~85 KB |
| `kotlinx-coroutines-core`    | `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.9.0` | ✓ ~328 KB   |
| `okio`                       | `com.squareup.okio:okio:3.9.1`                        | ✓ ~171 KB   |

ktlsp downloads the sources jars itself, so you do **not** need Gradle installed to use this
fixture. Running `gradle dependencies` (if Gradle is available) only pre-populates the local
Gradle cache, which ktlsp will reuse if present.

## Notes

- The catalog uses only the `module = "group:artifact"` + `version.ref` form, which is the
  subset of version-catalog syntax that `src/catalog.rs::parse_catalog` supports — every entry
  resolves to a full `group:artifact:version`.
- The Kotlin sources are compile-shaped (correct syntax, real library APIs verified against the
  published sources jars) but the fixture is not required to be built to be useful to ktlsp.
- This fixture intentionally does **not** compile clean: several files (`_Probe.kt`,
  `CoroutinesProbe.kt`, etc.) contain partial identifiers like `g.gr` / `s.upper` used as
  *completion probes* by the headless smoke tests. For a clean-compiling Gradle baseline (used
  by the diagnostics-backend bench harness) use `dev/multimodule-sample` or a generated
  `dev/bench-fixture/` instead.

## Pinned Gradle wrapper

A Gradle **8.10.2** wrapper is committed here (`gradlew`, `gradle/wrapper/*`) so that any build
or benchmark uses a pinned, reproducible toolchain rather than whatever `gradle` happens to be
on `PATH`. 8.10.2 is within the supported Gradle range for the Kotlin 2.1.20 plugin this fixture
declares. Note: this project pins `jvmToolchain(17)`, so a JDK 17 must be discoverable to build
it; `dev/multimodule-sample` pins no toolchain and builds on the running JDK.
